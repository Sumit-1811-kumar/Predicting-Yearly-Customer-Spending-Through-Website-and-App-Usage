# Predicting-Yearly-Customer-Spending-Through-Website-and-App-Usage
This project uses regression analysis to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers based on their interaction with a company's mobile app, website, and membership duration. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions — particularly whether to invest more in mobile or web platforms.

# Problem Statement
The company wants to understand:
Should we focus more on mobile app development or website improvements to increase customer spending?

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
* Avg. Session Length – Average time spent per session
* Time on App – Daily time spent on the mobile app
* Time on Website – Daily time spent on the website
* Length of Membership – How long the user has been a member
* Yearly Amount Spent – Target variable (amount spent in dollars)

# Model Used
Linear Regression is applied to:
* Predict customer spending
* Analyze feature importance through regression coefficients
* Check model assumptions: linearity, residuals, homoscedasticity

# Conclusion: 
The company should focus more on the mobile app to drive revenue, while also nurturing long-term memberships.
